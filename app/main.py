'We created a user-friendly developer platform and provide api for the same to show how prompt based learning, which is a zero shot learning approach for large language models, can optimize for trivial tasks and find an appropriate response given a suitable prompt. This will help us automate trivial generation tasks which normally need human input in them.'
